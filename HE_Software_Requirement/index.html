                <p><strong>Product Function:</strong></p>
<p>The organizations that are using Habit Explorer for boosting habitual usage of their products can create apps (like Credit Card, Digital Banking, etc..) depending upon their requirements with required events. Apps works with the specific models (models are Machine learning Algorithms) to generate the Recommendations. Under the specific app a user can create any number of personas, Personas are specific group of customers of that particular organization. For example, the customers with age group less than 30 and the customers who are with that organization at least 6 months can be made as a persona. Personas contains several other attributes which we discuss later. For a persona user can select the events which were made by the persona so that habit path can be generated based on the events that are performed bypersona.</p>

<li><strong>Apps Controller</strong></li>
<li><strong>Persona Controllers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Events Controllers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Insights Controllers</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Apps Controller</strong>:</p>
<p>Apps controller contains all CURD operations related to apps that are created.Apps related information will be stored in apps table in DB. Apps depend upon the specific models to give required recommendations.</p>
<p>EX: Digital Banking, Credit Card etc...</p>
<p>Apps can be grouped, so that permissions for accessing the app given based on the user group ID. Apps groups information available in the app group table.</p>
<p><strong>Persona Controllers:</strong></p>
<p>Personas are specific group of customers of the organization. Persona Controller contains all CURD operations related to personas. Required number of personas can be created for the app depending upon the requirement by the user.</p>
<p>Personas will have the persona attributes. Depending upon the app the persona attributes may changes.</p>
<p>Personas information will be stored in persona table with selected persona attribute. And the which user created the persona with persona ID will store in User Perona Table.</p>
<p>For example persona attributes canbe,vintage of the customers(means particular period of months or years customer stayed with the organization), Account type (savings or current), Digital Activity (active or inactive), gender (male orfemale.</p>
<p><strong>Event Controllers:</strong></p>
<p>Once the user created the persona,user can add the events made by the persona(group of customers of particular characteristics). Events for the app will be available in events table, where the selected events will be stored in persona eventstable.</p>
<p>Events are the particular operation done by the persona like Digital payment done through UPI, Electricity Bill Payment, Mobile Bill Payment, savings, loans payments etc...</p>
<p>Events depend upon apps. Different apps contain different events.</p>
<p>Once the events where added by the users the recommended habit path is generated. Selected persona attributes with selected events and non-selected events was passed to the model. Models gives the probability of each event to be recommended.Were commend the events for which habitual score increases the maximum by performing that particularevents.</p>
<p>Once the habitual score reaches the maximum means where by performing any event habitual score does not increases then that persona is said to be Habitual User.</p>
<p><strong>Habitual Score: Habitual AI model</strong></p>
<p><strong>Persona Insights: Performance Parameter Models</strong></p>
<h4 id="software-requirement">Software Requirement</h4>
<ul>
<li>Spark, Scala,Python</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-requirements">Data requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>User wise transaction history with there commendation for atleast 24months.</li>
<li>Pre-Post data for 6 months (3 months pre – campaign – 3 post period). Pre period data is kept similar to Pre period data on which Habitual AI model has been trained on. It could also be 1-month pre – campaign – 1-monthpost.</li>
<li>Conversion, retention and consistency metric have been trained on post period of 1, 2, 3 months respectively on a preperiodof one month. (These requirements are fixed from business point ofview).</li>
<li>Event recommendations will be from a set of events, on which we train the habitualmodel.</li>
<li>Keep note of event_l1_id and event_l2_id used in variousbanks.</li>
<li>Habit score output (user_id, event_name) for each user who were recommended a feature. (from Habitual AImodel)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="constraints">Constraints</h4>
<ul>
<li>The input data must be in Octopus format or need to be converted in required format.</li>
<li>
<p>Only the debit events and digital events are considered as features, and the model is trained only for salaried account users. (This constraint can be modified depending on the requirements from thebanks).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The habitual AI model generates recommendation for each user, but due to campaigning constraints (which includes cost and time/ DND services) we do not send a recommendation to each user. So, werunour model only on the users who were recommended afeature.</p>
</li>
<li>The attribute names for different banks is different. For working on a single code, a pre-processing need to be done to get data in the sameformat.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>All the calculation for performance parameters is calculated based on definitions provided in section below (Calculation of performance/campaign insights for HabitExplorer).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risks-and-contingencies">Risks and Contingencies</h4>
<ul>
<li>The hypothesis of expected conversion rate correlating positively with Habitual Score might not project correct results(this may be due to data or the trend) leading in drop of the conversion rate fromUI.</li>
<li>All the models are trained independently, and might show little or no correlation.(This needs to be fixed in futurerelease).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-mining-goals">Data mining goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>To project the expected conversion rate,we need to model the user behaviour to predict the conversion rate. We plan to use a regression (linear,non-linear) model to accurately predict the conversionrate.</li>
<li><strong>Predictive Model</strong> : We will create an ML model such as regression which will predict the conversion rate. The input training data X (user demographics and events which the user has done in the past (pre-period), recommendation from Habitual AI model) and target data Y will be created from pre-post data following the parameter definitions given below. (in section performance parameters).</li>
</ul>
<p>Initally, the X label (or features) were created for a single user as pivoting all events and create black and white features (Whether userhas donethe event or not), Recommendation from Habitual AI and user demographics (which might be one-hot encoded or labelled feature) or continuous features. This implied foreachuser a single feature vector is created</p>
<p>which didn&#39;t incorporate the trend of the user for each event.Hence,for BancoPAN we came up with following idea.</p>
<p>X label generation: For every user, a path history is created, give the assumption that a user is recommended one of the features (from the merchant category). This means that for each user at most 22 paths) can be generated, which shows how the behavior changes if he/she does a particular feature. Other than merchant features, the persona of the user is also considered into account (age, gender, global_limit, card_type, home_state). Here R, is the recommended feature. (Internal Id is only for mapping purpose, won&#39;t be considered as a feature.). All the features performed by the users are in the pre period (a month before the campaign_date, inclusive).</p>

<p>Digital Activity: -- The target will be the ratio of digital transactions to the total transactions in the post period by the user.</p>
<p>Spend Activation: Average transaction done by the user.</p>
<p><strong>Variety</strong> : Number of distinct events performed by a user in post period (one month from campaign date).(For future release this can be projected as buckets, which may reduce the error)</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong> : Number of events performed by a user in post period (one month from campaign date).(For future release this can be projected as buckets, which may reduce the error)</p>
<p><strong>Conversion</strong> : True, if a user performs a given recommendation in the post period (one month from campaign date). The target is the probability ofconversion.</p>
<p><strong>Retention</strong> : True, givenifa user is converted and inthesubsequent two months he performs the same event as recommended in at least either of themonth.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> : True, if a user is converted and performs the same event for subsequent two months.</p>

<p><strong>Insight Controllers:</strong>
These insights are used to get the metrics (spends and volumes) of the credit card transactions for each persona created by the user</p>
<p>By Calendar Insights: Calendar insights are to display the spends and volumes of the month wise transactions in a heat map.</p>
<p>By Trends Insights: Trend insights are to display the spends and unique users of the selected month wise transactions of the selected categories sorted by rank.</p>
